##  Project work by Premangshu Chanda, Shubham Chatterjee, Asoke Nath, Pallab Mukherjee

The aim of the project is to be able to transfer data using LEDs. The technique is called Li-Fi technology.

Version 1
	-> Audio Transmission using Li-Fi
	-> Circuits: Phone Circuit as Transmitter, Speaker circuit as Receiver
	-> Components: 3.5 mm audio jack, Breadboard, Wires, Cables:  Male to Male and Male to female, 100 ohm and 1Kohm resistors, Alligator clips, 9V battery
	-> 6V solar cell, Speaker with 3.5 mm audio In, 2 way 3.5 mm  jack
	-> Setup as in the circuits 
	-> Audio transmitted successfully
	
	Version 1 released!!
	
Version 2
	-> Including Arduino UNO ATMEGA32 in the project
	
	-> Completed Connection of Arduino with LEDs
	-> Completed Connection of Arduino with LDR
	-> Successfully blinked LEDs
	-> Successfully transmitted a single data
	-> Sucessfully blinked LEDs via transmission of data from contents of a text file on disk
	-> Used processing3.1.1 (Used Java code here) with Arduino to transmit data
	
Version 3
	## Final Stage of Project ###
	### Aim is to be able to transfer any kind of data	###
	-> USB to LED Data transmision problem solved.
	-> Successfully completed Receiver end of the Li-Fi ( modifying cyhex's flashCom)
	-> Suceessfully completed Hardware setup of the Transceiver - Receiver
	-> Testing of Data transmission data using light and receiving it ; Successfully
	
	### Sorted the Versions Groupwise into separate folders; LiFi Audio Transmission, LiFi textReader, LiFi UDTR(Universal Data Transmision & Receiving)
	### To modify: Transmission end to send controlled data by blinking of LEDs
	### To modify; Hardware setup to display received data in human-readable format
