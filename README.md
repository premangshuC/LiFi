##  Project work by Premangshu Chanda, Shubham Chatterjee, Asoke Nath

The aim of the project is to be able to transfer data using LEDs. The technique is called Li-Fi technology.

Version 1
	-> Audio Transmission using Li-Fi
	-> Circuits: Phone Circuit as Transmitter, Speaker circuit as Receiver
	-> Components: 3.5 mm audio jack, Breadboard, Wires, Cables:  Male to Male and Male to female, 100 ohm and 1Kohm resistors, Alligator clips, 9V battery
	-> 6V solar cell, Speaker with 3.5 mm audio In, 2 way 3.5 mm  jack
	-> Setup as in the circuits 
	-> Audio transmitted successfully
	
	Version 1 released!!
	
Version 2
	-> Including Arduino UNO ATMEGA32 in the project
	
	-> Completed Connection of Arduino with LEDs
	-> Completed Connection of Arduino with LDR
	-> Successfully blinked LEDs
	-> Successfully transmitted a single data
	-> Sucessfully blinked LEDs via transmission of data from contents of a text file on disk
	-> Used processing3.1.1 (Used Java code here) with Arduino to transmit data
	
Version 3
	## Final Stage of Project ###
	###  Aim is to be able to transfer any kind of data	###
	-> Implenetation in progress: Use USB cable to transfer data to LED sources on transmission end and receive data from solar cell to receiver end 
	### USB to LED Data transmision problem solved.
		Planning of Serial data (Universal) transfer completed.
		To implement: Serial data transfer from a host(Computer) to LED and receive the data from LED to some other host.
